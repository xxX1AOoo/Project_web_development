Relevant information on FEARLESS Clubs Platform Web:

We basiclly used HTML, CSS, Javascriptï¼ŒVUE, AJAX, Express as our server, NodeJS and SQL.

We recommand that new users sign up a new account to use our web application, because our database just contains two users who are an admin and a club manager for Fitness Club. Their password has hashed as well.

For guests, you can view our homepage, events, clubs' public posts and some other pages, but not allowed to access user profile page by clicking the 'head' on menu bar. Also you cannot join any clubs until you logged in.

For a user, you can click the 'head' to access your profile and view your basic information. You can update you information and avatar as well. Furthermore, if you have joined any clubs, you can check the joined clubs list, posts and events with RSVP. The 'Events' on the left user menu bar can show your RSVPs and some RSVP'd events.

For a club manager, you can manage your club on the club homepage, such as posting updates publicly or privately, creating new events, checking members list, checking RSVP'd members and sharing events to your twitter.

For an admin, you can access your admin system on your user menu bar. In the system, you can check every member with their basic information and joined clubs information (the users list can sorted by clubs). You can add or delete any member, and sign up any member as an admin. Also you can manage clubs by adding, deleting, or modifying clubs. Once you create a new club, the club homepage can be viewed on clubs page with some basic information.
